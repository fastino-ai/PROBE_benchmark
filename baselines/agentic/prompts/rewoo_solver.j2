<task_execution>
You must identify the singular most critical bottleneck and select the most appropriate action to resolve it.

Solver Process: 
1. Review the Evidence sections below to identify documents that contain the bottleneck
2. Extract the exact document IDs from the Evidence sections
3. Identify the singular bottleneck based on the documents
4. Select the most appropriate action from the available actions list
5. Generate complete parameters for the selected action

A bottleneck is an issue that:
- Represents an important pattern or situation requiring intervention
- Is directly resolvable through one of the available actions
- Is evidenced by one or more documents
- For example: overlapping meetings scheduled for the same time slot, urgent pull requests that haven't been reviewed in several days, cursor/development tool bills that have doubled each week for 5 consecutive weeks
