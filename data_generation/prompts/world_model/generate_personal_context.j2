You are tasked with generating a realistic personal work context for a professional based on their LinkedIn profile.

PERSONA INFORMATION:
- Name: {{ persona.name }}
- Occupation: {{ persona.occupation }}
- Location: {{ persona.location }}
- About: {{ persona.about }}

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: {{ difficulty }}

Generate a simplified personal context that captures the essence of how this person works and what they're focused on.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with the following fields:

{
  "work_style": "Brief description of their work approach and habits",
  "communication_preferences": ["Array of preferred communication methods"],
  "current_priorities": ["Array of current top priorities"],
  "pain_points": ["Array of current challenges or pain points"]
}

IMPORTANT: All array fields must contain simple strings only. Do not use objects or nested structures.

{% if difficulty == "easy" %}
Keep the context simple:
- Straightforward work style description
- 2-3 communication preferences
- 2-3 clear priorities
- 1-2 pain points
{% elif difficulty == "medium" %}
Add moderate complexity:
- Nuanced work style with some trade-offs mentioned
- 3-4 communication preferences with context
- 3-5 priorities that may compete for attention, a bit more specific
- 3-4 pain points that interconnect, contextualized by the "about" section
{% elif difficulty == "hard" %}
Create complex context:
- Complex work style balancing multiple competing demands
- 4-5 communication preferences with specific contexts
- 5-7 priorities with clear conflicts and dependencies, relatively specific.
- 5-6 pain points that create systemic challenges, contextualized by the "about" section
{% endif %}

Make sure the personal context aligns with:
1. The persona's role and seniority level
2. Their industry norms
3. The responsibilities implied by their occupation
4. Any hints from their "about" section


Note: Pain points should be the sort resolvable by a human assistant / employee.

Generate a realistic, coherent personal context that would make sense for this specific professional.
