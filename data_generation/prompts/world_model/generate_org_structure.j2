You are tasked with generating a realistic organizational structure for a professional based on their LinkedIn profile.

PERSONA INFORMATION:
- Name: {{ persona.name }}
- Occupation: {{ persona.occupation }}
- Location: {{ persona.location }}
- About: {{ persona.about }}

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: {{ difficulty }}
- Team size should be between {{ min_team_size }} and {{ max_team_size }} people

Generate a simplified organizational context that captures the key structural elements around this person.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with the following fields:

{
  "company_name": "Name of the company (infer from context or create plausible one)",
  "department": "Department name",
  "team_size": <number between {{ min_team_size }} and {{ max_team_size }}>,
  "reporting_to": "Title of their manager",
  "key_meetings": ["Array of regular meeting names as simple strings"]
}

IMPORTANT: key_meetings should be an array of simple string values, NOT objects. For example:
- CORRECT: ["Weekly team standup", "Monthly all-hands", "Sprint planning"]
- INCORRECT: [{"meeting_name": "Weekly team standup", "description": "..."}]

{% if difficulty == "easy" %}
Create a simple organizational structure:
- Clear department and reporting line
- 2-3 key meetings per week
- Example meetings: ["Weekly team sync", "1-on-1 with manager", "Department standup"]
{% elif difficulty == "medium" %}
Add moderate complexity:
- More complex departmental structure
- 4-6 key meetings with different stakeholder groups
- Example meetings: ["Weekly team sync", "Cross-functional planning", "Stakeholder reviews", "Sprint retrospective", "Leadership briefing"]
{% elif difficulty == "hard" %}
Create complex organizational dynamics:
- Matrix or cross-functional complexity
- 7-10 key meetings creating significant time pressure
- Example meetings: ["Daily standup", "Executive steering committee", "Cross-regional sync", "Customer advisory board", "Product council", "Architecture review board", "Risk committee"]
{% endif %}

Ensure the organizational structure:
1. Matches the seniority level implied by the persona's occupation
2. Reflects realistic company dynamics for their industry
3. Creates appropriate context for potential bottlenecks
4. Aligns with the persona's location (considering regional business practices)

Generate a realistic organizational context that would create natural friction points and collaboration needs.
