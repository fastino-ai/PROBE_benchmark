# Three-Step Checklist Generation

You are generating a three-step evaluation checklist for a proactive AI agent. The checklist must evaluate the agent's ability to:
1. **Search**: Verify the correct data sources were retrieved
2. **Identification**: Verify the correct problem was recognized
3. **Task Selection**: Choose the appropriate action and parameter values

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team Size**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.team_size }}
- **Reports To**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.reporting_to }}

### Personal Work Context
- **Work Style**: {{ world_model.personal_context.work_style }}
- **Communication Preferences**: {{ world_model.personal_context.communication_preferences | join(", ") }}
- **Current Priorities**: {{ world_model.personal_context.current_priorities | join(", ") }}
- **Pain Points**: {{ world_model.personal_context.pain_points | join(", ") }}

### Key Relationships
{% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}
- **{{ rel.name }}** ({{ rel.type.value }}): {{ rel.relationship_context }}
{% endfor %}

### Bottleneck to Resolve
- **Type**: {{ bottleneck.type }}
- **Description**: {{ bottleneck.description }}
## Available Actions to Resolve Bottleneck
{% for action in available_actions %}
- **{{ action.id }}** ({{ action.type }}): {{ action.description }}{% if action.params_schema.required %} [required params: {{ action.params_schema.required | join(", ") }}]{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Task

Generate a JSON object with three evaluation steps.

### Step 1: Search Step
Define the MINIMAL set of data sources needed to identify the bottleneck:
- **CRITICAL**: Only include data sources that are ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to identify the problem
- **MANDATORY NUMBER OF SOURCES FOR {{ difficulty|upper }} DIFFICULTY**:
{%- if difficulty == "easy" %}
  - **EXACTLY 1-2 sources** (no more, no less)
{%- elif difficulty == "medium" %}
  - **EXACTLY 2-3 sources** (no more, no less)
{%- else %}
  - **EXACTLY 3-5 sources** (no more, no less)
{%- endif %}
- For harder difficulties, split evidence across multiple sources so no single source reveals everything
- Each source should provide partial information that must be combined
- Focus on the most direct evidence types (emails, documents, calendar events)
- Avoid redundant or nice-to-have information

### Step 2: Identification Step
Define how to verify the correct problem was recognized:
- The exact problem that should be identified is already provided in the bottleneck description
- This step simply checks that the agent recognized this specific issue

### Step 3: Task Selection Step
Define the correct action and parameters to resolve the bottleneck:
- Choose the specific action ID (not just the type) from the available list
- Specify the exact parameter values needed
- Consider the context and relationships when setting parameters
## Example (for reference)
For a double-booked meeting bottleneck:
```json
{
  "search_step": {
    "description": "Check that calendar events and meeting invites were retrieved",
    "expected_sources": ["calendar_events", "meeting_invitations"]
  },
  "identification_step": {
    "description": "Verify that the double_booked_meetings problem was correctly identified"
  },
  "task_selection_step": {
    "description": "Select reschedule_meeting action to move one of the conflicting meetings",
    "correct_action": "reschedule_meeting",
    "correct_parameters": {
      "meeting_id": "meet-q3-budget-2024",
      "attendees": ["Sarah Chen", "infrastructure team"],
      "new_time": "Tuesday 3pm",
      "reason": "Conflict with sprint planning"
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements
1. **Search**: List EXACTLY {% if difficulty == "easy" %}1-2{% elif difficulty == "medium" %}2-3{% else %}3-5{% endif %} data sources
   - Each source should provide partial evidence
   - No single source should reveal the entire bottleneck
   - Use highly specific and realistic source names (e.g., "email_threads_regarding_financial_analytics_from_Q1", "Q2_financial_report_documents", "calendar_events_for_team_meetings", "slack_messages_with_manager_wednesday_01_23", "jira_tickets_related_to_latest_neuralnet_deployment")
2. **Identification**: Confirm the specific bottleneck was recognized
3. **Task Selection**: Choose the specific action ID (from the available actions list) & parameters that DIRECTLY RESOLVE the bottleneck
