Generate realistic document items for this workplace context that DO NOT contain any information helpful for resolving the bottleneck. Note that these should be in the desired word count.

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team Size**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.team_size }}
- **Reports To**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.reporting_to }}

## Personal Context
- **Work Style**: {{ world_model.personal_context.work_style }}
- **Communication Preferences**: {{ world_model.personal_context.communication_preferences | join(", ") }}
- **Current Priorities**: {{ world_model.personal_context.current_priorities | join(", ") }}
- **Pain Points**: {{ world_model.personal_context.pain_points | join(", ") }}

## Key Relationships
{% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}
- **{{ rel.name }}** ({{ rel.type.value }}): {{ rel.relationship_context }}
{% endfor %}

## Bottleneck(s) to AVOID
**Important**: Generate items that are completely unrelated to this bottleneck, or any problem the user would find important based on their context/personal context:
- {{ bottleneck.description }}

## Available Actions Context
The user has access to these types of actions:
{% for action in actions[:10] %}
- **{{ action.type }}**: {{ action.description }}
{% endfor %}

**CRITICAL**: Distractors should relate to similar workplace activities but NOT directly address any of these actions. Create content that might seem relevant to these action types but doesn't actually require or suggest using them.

## Strategic Distractor Types
Employ these specific distractor strategies to create confusing but non-actionable groups of documents. Recall that documents can work together to create a narrative (e.g. propose a bottleneck in one document and invalidate it in another document):

- **Proposal-Dismissal**: Document proposing a potential bottleneck, but with annotations/updates from another document claiming it's no longer relevant
- **Outdated Bottleneck**: Document about a bottleneck from months/years ago that's no longer actionable
- **Awaiting Approval**: Document detailing a potential bottleneck that another document claims is deprioritized and awaiting long-term executive approval
- **Unaddressable Distractor**: Document about a clear bottleneck that's completely outside the persona's control/authority
- **Resolved-But-Mentioned**: Document discussing a bottleneck-like situation that was already resolved by another document that you previously generated..
- **False-Positive-Similarity**: Use similar keywords/entities to the bottleneck but in completely different contexts
- **Delegation-Complete**: Document proposing an issue and another document showing someone else is handling a similar issue, not the user's concern
- **Contingency-Planning**: Document discussing backup plans for hypothetical issues that may never occur
- **Historical-Reference**: Document mentioning similar past problems but emphasizing they're ancient history
- **Scope-Mismatch**: Document about problems in different teams/departments outside the user's authority
- **Urgent-But-Not-Actionable**: Document shows an extremely urgent issue that user has no authority to address
- **Evolution-to-resolution**: A few of your documents show the evolution of a bottleneck until one document claims it has resolved the issue.

## Requirements
- Generate {{ count }} document items
- Items should be natural, highly specific workplace documents
- They should fit the organizational context or reference some personal context
- They must NOT contain any information that would help identify or resolve the bottleneck
- **Items should not be both important and actionable to {{ world_model.persona_full_name }} (based on the actions provided)!!**
- Any date chosen should be a random date in 2025
- Document body length: {{ min_words }}-{{ max_words }} words
- **ACTION-AWARE DOCUMENTS**: Create documents that relate to or mention the available actions but do NOT require or suggest using those specific actions
- **INDIRECT RELEVANCE**: Make documents seem very relevant to the priorities, pain points, and action items, but not directly address the bottleneck or present a problem the user would find important based on their context/personal context.
