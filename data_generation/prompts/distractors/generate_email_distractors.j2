Generate realistic email items for this workplace context that DO NOT contain any information that mentions any of the  bottleneck. Note that these should be in the desired word count.

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team Size**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.team_size }}
- **Colleagues**: {% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}{{ rel.name }} ({{ rel.type.value }}){% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

## Available Email Addresses
**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY these real email addresses from the world model relationships (do NOT invent new ones):
{% for rel in world_model.relationships[:8] %}
- **{{ rel.name }}**: {{ rel.name.lower().replace(' ', '.') }}@{{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name.lower().replace(' ', '').replace('.', '') }}.com
{% endfor %}

## Personal Context
- **Work Style**: {{ world_model.personal_context.work_style }}
- **Current Priorities**: {{ world_model.personal_context.current_priorities | join(", ") }}
- **Pain Points**: {{ world_model.personal_context.pain_points | join(", ") }}

## Bottleneck(s) to AVOID
**CRITICAL**: Generate items that are completely unrelated to this bottleneck and contain NO information that could help identify, understand, or resolve it:
- {{ bottleneck.description }}

**CONTAMINATION PREVENTION**: Emails must NOT contain:
- Any direct or indirect references to the bottleneck situation
- Any problems, delays, conflicts, or issues that could be confused with the bottleneck
- Any information that would be useful for resolving the bottleneck
- Any context clues that might hint at the existence of a serious issue that {{ world_model.persona_full_name }} would find important and actionable (by him specifically!!)

## Available Actions Context
The user has access to these types of actions:
{% for action in actions[:10] %}
- **{{ action.type }}**: {{ action.description }}
{% endfor %}

**STRATEGIC DISTRACTION**: Items should leverage context, personal context, and available actions to create realistic workplace content that appears relevant but is completely unrelated to any bottlenecks. Create content that mentions action types in passing or as background context, but does NOT suggest using them for problem-solving or present any situations requiring action.

## Requirements
- Generate {{ count }} email items
- Items should be natural, highly specific workplace / personal communications without flashy or dramatic titles
- They should fit the organizational context and reference occasional details of the world model
- **ZERO BOTTLENECK CONTAMINATION**: Items must contain absolutely NO information that would help identify, understand, or resolve the bottleneck
- **NO PROBLEM CONTENT**: Avoid presenting ANY problems, issues, delays, conflicts, or situations requiring action from {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}!!
- They should be about completely unrelated workplace topics (team events, celebrations, routine updates, informational content, etc.)
- Today's date is March 15th, 2025, so any dates should be in the near past or future
- Email body length: {{ min_words }}-{{ max_words }} words
- **ACTION-AWARE EMAILS**: Create emails that relate to or mention the available actions but do NOT require or suggest using those specific actions (ex: "if action is escalate_to_manager, then email should say something like "escalating this issue to management might be an option, but I'm not sure if it's the best course of action" or "we may need to escalate this to management if all of other preliminary attempts fail")
- **INDIRECT RELEVANCE**: Make emails seem very relevant to the priorities, pain points, and action items, but not directly address the bottleneck or present a problem the user would find important based on their context/personal context.

## Strategic Distractor Types
Employ these specific distractor strategies to create confusing but non-actionable emails:

- **Proposal-Dismissal**: Email proposing a potential bottleneck, but with follow-up replies claiming it's no longer relevant
- **Outdated Bottleneck**: Email about a bottleneck from months/years ago that's no longer actionable
- **Awaiting Approval**: Emails detailing a potential bottleneck that's deprioritized pending long-term executive approval
- **Unaddressable Distractor**: Email about a clear bottleneck that's completely outside the persona's control/authority
- **Resolved-But-Mentioned**: Email discussing a bottleneck-like situation that was already resolved recently
- **False-Positive-Similarity**: Use similar keywords/entities to the bottleneck but in completely different contexts
- **Delegation-Complete**: Email showing someone else is handling a similar issue, not the user's concern
- **Contingency-Planning**: Email discussing backup plans for hypothetical issues that may never occur
- **Historical-Reference**: Email mentioning similar past problems but emphasizing they're ancient history
- **Scope-Mismatch**: Email about problems in different teams/departments outside the user's authority

## Anti-Bias Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **POPULATE RECIPIENTS**: Always include realistic to/cc fields with 1-3 addresses
- **CREATE RED HERRINGS**: Include names/terms that COULD be confused with bottleneck elements / actions
- **VARY SPECIFICITY**: Make some extremely specific emails, but never reference bottleneck.
- **TEMPORAL SPREAD**: Use dates from March 10-20, not all March 15th
- **MIXED LENGTHS**: Vary between short updates and longer discussions
- **PARTIAL RELEVANCE**: Include content that's tangentially related to work areas

The new space features:\n- Open collaboration areas with standing desks\n- Dedicated quiet zones for focused work\n- State-of-the-art meeting rooms with upgraded AV equipment\n- On-site gym and wellness center\n- Electric vehicle charging stations\n\n**Recently Resolved Issues:**\nGood news - several challenges from last month have been successfully addressed:\n- The server capacity issues that were affecting deployment speeds? Completely resolved with our new infrastructure upgrade last week\n- The budget approval delays for the Q4 marketing campaigns have been finalized - Finance approved everything on Friday\n- Remember the conflict between the mobile app redesign and API v3 timelines? The leadership team worked out a resource reallocation plan and both projects are back on track\n- The authentication service specifications that were holding up backend development finally came through from Security - development resumed Monday\n\n**Packing Schedule:**\nWe request that everyone share this email thread with any colleagues who have yet to receive it to ensure company-wide circulation. We also recommend that you show up to office early next week to attend our new headquarters tour!\n- Sept 30: IT will provide moving boxes and labels\n- Oct 8-10: Professional movers will pack common areas\n- Oct 11-12: Personal desk items should be packed\n\n**Long-term Planning Items (Awaiting Executive Approval):**\nSeveral strategic initiatives are currently in the executive review pipeline, pending long-term approval from the CEO's office:\n- The proposed expansion into European markets (detailed business case submitted, awaiting Q1 2026 strategic review)\n- Office space lease extensions for our satellite locations (facilities team has prepared comprehensive proposals, awaiting board-level approval)\n- The comprehensive employee training program redesign (HR has completed all planning, but implementation is on hold pending budget cycle approval)\n\nThese items aren't blocking any immediate work - just keeping you informed of the bigger picture planning that's happening at the executive level.\n\n**New Policies Starting November 1st:**\n1.

### Hard Difficulty Examples

#### Example 1: Weekly Security Update (When bottleneck is about meeting conflicts)
**Bottleneck to avoid**: "You (Jack) have two important meetings scheduled at the same time on Tuesday at 2pm: the product roadmap review with the CEO and the client presentation with ABC Corp."

```json
{
  "subject": "Weekly Security Scan Results - Urgent items to address",
  "sender": "[use actual colleague email from Available Email Addresses section]",

  "cc": ["infrastructure@company.com"],
  "timestamp": "2025-03-17T08:00:00Z",
  "body": "Morning team,\n\nWeekly security scan results for March 14th. Some interesting findings this week that I wanted to share with everyone.\n\n**Vulnerability Assessment - Project Fortress:**\nRan our comprehensive scan across 247 systems in the infrastructure. The automated pipeline flagged a few items:\n- Critical vulnerabilities: 0\n- High severity: 0 \n- Medium severity: 3 (remediation completed during Tuesday maintenance)\n- Low severity: 12 (queued for next maintenance window)\n\nThat endpoint issue we discovered last week on Melissa's workstation has been contained. The EDR system caught it quickly and we've completed the investigation - no evidence of lateral movement or data exfiltration.\n\n**Infrastructure Compliance Status:**\n- Windows server environment: 100% patched to current baselines\n- Linux production systems: 100% compliant with security standards\n- Network devices: 98% up-to-date (2 edge routers need reboot after firmware update)\n- Workstation fleet: 96% current on security patches\n\n**Threat Landscape Update:**\nOur perimeter defenses intercepted some notable activity:\n- Firewall blocked 1,247 suspicious IP addresses attempting connections\n- Email security gateway filtered 15,892 spam and phishing attempts\n- Zero successful unauthorized access events detected\n- Certificate management system shows all SSL certs valid through June\n\n**Recently Addressed Items:**\nJust to close the loop on some previous concerns - the LDAP authentication latency issues that were causing SSO delays got resolved when the network team implemented the new load balancers last month. Also, those certificate expiration alerts for the API gateway are no longer triggering since we renewed everything and set up automated monitoring.\n\nThe firewall rule conflicts between DMZ and internal networks that infrastructure was troubleshooting? Those configuration issues were sorted out and we're seeing clean traffic flow now.\n\n**Strategic Security Planning:**\nA few longer-term initiatives are working through the planning pipeline - Zero Trust architecture evaluation is in the business case phase for 2026 budget consideration. The advanced threat hunting platform upgrade has completed vendor assessment and is awaiting CIO review. Employee security training modernization is also in development with HR for next fiscal cycle implementation.\n\n**This Week's Completions:**\n✅ Quarterly password policy compliance audit\n✅ WAF rule updates for emerging attack patterns\n✅ Security awareness training deployment for new hires\n✅ Backup restoration testing validation\n✅ Incident response playbook exercises\n\n**Scheduled Maintenance:**\n- March 21st: Firewall firmware updates (11 PM - 1 AM)\n- March 28th: Email system security patches (6 AM - 7 AM) \n- April 4th: Annual penetration testing kickoff\n\n**Security Awareness:**\nExcellent results on last week's phishing simulation - 94% identification and reporting rate! The email filters just caught an amusing attempt - someone claiming to be a Nigerian prince offering $40 million. That's our highest fake payout offer yet.\n\nRemember back in 2020 when we transitioned to remote work? Similar concerns about endpoint security, but our metrics actually improved with better awareness and monitoring.\n\n**General Notes:**\n- Mobile security updates available through device management portal\n- Suspicious email reporting via Outlook plugin or security@company.com\n- Q1 security training at 87% completion - portal open through March 31st\n\nProject Hardening automation features roll out next week. Will send details on the enhanced monitoring capabilities.\n\nStay sharp,\nDavid\nSenior Security Engineer\n\nP.S. - Coffee and pastries in the security office Friday morning for anyone interested in InfoSec career discussions!",
