Generate realistic calendar event items for this workplace context that DO NOT contain any information helpful for resolving the bottleneck.

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team**: {% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}{{ rel.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

## Personal Context
- **Current Priorities**: {{ world_model.personal_context.current_priorities | join(", ") }}
- **Work Style**: {{ world_model.personal_context.work_style }}

## Bottleneck(s) to AVOID
**Important**: Generate items that are completely unrelated to this bottleneck, or any problem the user would find important based on their context/personal context:
- {{ bottleneck.description }}

## Available Actions Context
The user has access to these types of actions:
{% for action in actions[:10] %}
- **{{ action.type }}**: {{ action.description }}
{% endfor %}

**CRITICAL**: Distractors should relate to similar workplace activities but NOT directly address any of these actions. Create content that might seem relevant to these action types but doesn't actually require or suggest using them.

## Strategic non-actionable calendar event types (generated events should work together/relate)
Employ these specific distractor strategies to create confusing but non-actionable calendar events:

- **Proposal-Dismissal**: Meeting about a potential bottleneck that gets cancelled or notes indicate it's no longer relevant
- **Outdated Bottleneck**: Meeting about a bottleneck from months/years ago that's no longer actionable
- **Awaiting Approval**: Meeting discussing a potential bottleneck that's deprioritized pending long-term executive approval
- **Unaddressable Distractor**: Meeting about a clear bottleneck that's completely outside the persona's control/authority
- **Resolved-But-Mentioned**: Meeting discussing a bottleneck-like situation that was already resolved recently
- **False-Positive-Similarity**: Use similar keywords/entities to the bottleneck but in completely different contexts
- **Delegation-Complete**: Meeting showing someone else is handling a similar issue, not the user's concern
- **Contingency-Planning**: Meeting discussing backup plans for hypothetical issues that may never occur
- **Historical-Reference**: Meeting mentioning similar past problems but emphasizing they're ancient history
- **Scope-Mismatch**: Meeting about problems in different teams/departments outside the user's authority
- **Vendor-Dependency**: Meeting blocked on external vendor response or approval outside the persona's control


## Requirements
- Today's date is March 15th, 2025
- Generate {{ count }} calendar event items, preferably with some related to others but not exposing some mutual problem together.
- Items should be natural, highly specific workplace calendar events without flashy or dramatic titles
- They should fit the organizational context
- They must NOT contain any information that would help identify or resolve the bottleneck
- They should be about OTHER workplace activities (routine meetings, training, social events, etc.)
- Any date chosen should be a random date in 2025
- Include detailed descriptions that contain various agenda items or meeting notes
- **ACTION-AWARE EVENTS**: Create events that relate to or mention the available actions but do NOT require or suggest using those specific actions
- **INDIRECT RELEVANCE**: Make events seem very relevant to the priorities, pain points, and action items, but not directly address the bottleneck or present a problem the user would find important based on their context/personal context.

  "why_not_satisfy": "This is a birthday celebration event with no connection to budgets or infrastructure"
}
```

#### Example 2: Coffee Chat (When bottleneck is about meeting conflicts)
