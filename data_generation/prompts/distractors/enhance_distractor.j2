Enhance the following workplace {{ item_type.lower() }} to meet the requirements and leverage the context given to you effectively:

## Context
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}

## Available Actions Context
The user has access to these types of actions:
{% for action in actions %}
- **{{ action.type }}**: {{ action.description }}
{% endfor %}

The enhanced content should:
- Most important: contain no actual problems that the user should solve or address: any problems should pertain to other people and be inactionable by the user.
- Feel authentic, important, and workplace-appropriate
- **Be {{ min_words }}-{{ max_words }} words long - this is CRUCIAL**
- Include specific metrics, system names, or technical processes
- Have {{ urgency_level }} urgency cues (deadlines, stakeholder pressure, etc.)
- Contain 1-2 minor typos that feel natural
- Reference realistic workplace tools/systems (Jira, Slack, wiki links, etc.)

## Enhancement Requirements
1. **Length**: {{ min_words }}-{{ max_words }} words (currently appears shorter)
2. **Urgency level**: {{ urgency_level }} (add appropriate urgency cues, deadlines, stakeholder mentions)
3. **Technical details**: Include specific technical terms, metrics, system names, processes
4. **Professional tone**: Use corporate language with some jargon
5. **Natural elements**: Include 1-2 minor typos, a realistic link/reference, specific dates/times
6. **Action-aware content**: Make content always reference at least a few personal context and available actions, but **DO NOT** require or suggest using those actions to solve some problem that might be important to the user.

## Critical Constraints
**AVOID THESE BOTTLENECKS:**
{% for bottleneck in bottlenecks %}
- {{ bottleneck.description }}
{% endfor %}

## Original Content
{{ current_content }}

## Instructions
Rewrite the content to be longer, more urgent, and technically detailed while staying completely unrelated to the bottlenecks above and only including problems that are not important to / addressable by the user. Include natural imperfections like minor typos and realistic workplace references.

Return ONLY the enhanced content, no explanations or JSON formatting.
