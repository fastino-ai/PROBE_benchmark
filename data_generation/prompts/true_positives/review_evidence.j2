Review the generated evidence items to ensure they meet coordinated generation requirements and contain no contamination from other bottlenecks.

## Target Bottleneck
**Description**: {{ bottleneck.description }}
**Type**: {{ bottleneck.type }}

## Context Provided to the Agent
The agent will have access to:
- **Name**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team relationships**: {{ world_model.relationships | length }} colleagues
- **Available actions**: {{ world_model.available_actions | length }} possible actions
- **Personal priorities**: {{ world_model.personal_context.current_priorities | join(", ") }}

## Evidence Plan
**Coordination Strategy**: {{ evidence_plan.coordination_strategy }}

## Evidence Items to Review
{% for item in evidence_items %}
### Item {{ loop.index }}: {{ item.type }} (ID: {{ item.id }})
{% if item.type == "email" %}
**Subject**: {{ item.subject }}
**Content**: {{ item.content }}
{% elif item.type == "event" %}
**Title**: {{ item.title }}
**Description**: {{ item.description }}
{% elif item.type == "document" %}
**Title**: {{ item.title }}
**Content**: {{ item.content }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

## Other Bottlenecks to Check For Contamination
**CRITICAL**: Verify that NONE of the evidence items contain information related to these other bottlenecks:
{% for bottleneck_desc in other_bottlenecks %}
{{ bottleneck_desc }}
{% endfor %}


## Review Criteria


- For difficulty "{{ difficulty }}":
  {% if difficulty == "easy" %}
  - Evidence should be fairly clear when combined
  - Minimal inference required
  {% elif difficulty == "medium" %}
  - Evidence requires inference and world model usage, as well as interconnection between components.
  - Should not be immediately obvious
  - Minimal keyword overlap with bottleneck
  {% else %}
  - Evidence should be extremely subtle and fragmented, and requires significant inference and world model usage
  - Requires thorough interconnection between components to put bottleneck together, otherwise impossible.
  - Minimal to no keyword overlap with bottleneck
  {% endif %}

  ### 1. Coordination Check
- Does each item fulfill its assigned role from the evidence plan?
- Is the evidence distributed appropriately across items?
- Does each item provide only subtle, partial information?
- Would correlating all items together reveal the bottleneck?

### 2. Contamination Check
- Do any items contain information about the other bottlenecks listed above?
- Are there any references to problems/issues not related to the target bottleneck?
- Is the content related to the target bottleneck evidence?

### 3. Sufficiency Check
- Is any individual item insufficient to resolve the bottleneck alone? (This should never be the case)
- Do the items collectively provide enough evidence when correlated?
- Is the evidence appropriate for the {{ difficulty }} difficulty level?

### 4. Quality Check
- Is the content natural and realistic for workplace communication?
- Are the items well-integrated into broader workplace context?
- Do they maintain professional tone and authenticity?

### 5. Bias Prevention Check
- **Empty Recipients**: Do emails have realistic to/cc fields populated?
- **Content Balance**: Is specificity balanced between evidence and context?
- **Length Variation**: Are document lengths varied realistic?
- **Temporal Distribution**: Are timestamps spread across different days/times?
- **Narrative Subtlety**: Is the bottleneck thread very subtle rather than obvious? Is it prone to keywords like "issue" or "problem"?
- **Term Repetition**: Are key terms used sparingly (max 1-2 times total)?
- **Red Herrings**: Is there ambiguity/typos to prevent simple pattern matching?
- **Document Type Mix**: Are evidence items mixed naturally across types? Is any one document sufficient to identify the bottleneck?

## Review Instructions

Analyze each evidence item against the criteria above. Pay special attention to:

1. **Contamination Detection**: Look for ANY mention of the other bottlenecks, even indirect references
2. **Coordination Verification**: Ensure items work together as planned
3. **Individual Insufficiency**: Confirm no single item reveals the bottleneck - it should always require all items to be put together.
4. **Collective Sufficiency**: Verify all items together provide actionable evidence

Generate a JSON response with this structure:
```json
{
  "needs_refinement": boolean,
  "refinement_reason": "Explanation if refinement is needed",
  "contamination_detected": boolean,
  "contamination_details": "Details of any contamination found",
  "coordination_assessment": {
    "follows_plan": boolean,
    "individual_insufficiency": boolean,
    "collective_sufficiency": boolean,
    "explanation": "Assessment of coordination quality"
  },
  "refined_evidence": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "refinement_needed": boolean,
      "issues": ["List of specific issues"],
      "refined_content": {
        // Same structure as original, but with refined content
        // For email: subject, content
        // For calendar: title, description
        // For document: title, content
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
If no refinement is needed, return:
```json
{
  "needs_refinement": false,
  "refinement_reason": "Evidence meets all criteria",
  "refined_evidence": []
}
```

## Examples of Issues to Flag

### Contamination Examples:
- Item mentions budget approvals when that's in the "avoid" list
- Item references meeting conflicts when that's not the target bottleneck
- Item discusses staffing issues when that's not the target bottleneck

### Coordination Issues:
- Item provides complete bottleneck information instead of partial
- Items don't follow their assigned evidence roles
- Evidence is too concentrated in one item
- Items are collectively insufficient even when correlated

### Quality Issues:
- Unnatural or unrealistic workplace communication
- Too obvious or too subtle for the difficulty level
- Poor integration with workplace context, lacking in context usage
- Unprofessional tone or content
