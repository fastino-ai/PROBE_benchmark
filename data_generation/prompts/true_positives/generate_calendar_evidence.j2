Generate a realistic calendar event that fulfills this specific evidence role while avoiding contamination from other bottlenecks.

## Target Bottleneck
**Description**: {{ bottleneck.description }}
**Type**: {{ bottleneck.type }}

## Your Evidence Role
**Specific Role**: {{ evidence_role }}

This calendar event should provide ONLY the evidence specified in your role. Do NOT include complete information about the bottleneck - other documents will provide the missing pieces.

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team**: {% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}{{ rel.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}
- **Difficulty**: {{ world_model.context_difficulty.value }}

## Key Relationships (Potential Attendees)
{% for rel in world_model.relationships[:8] %}
- **{{ rel.name }}** ({{ rel.type.value }}): {{ rel.relationship_context }}
{% endfor %}

## CRITICAL: Bottlenecks to AVOID
**You must NOT include any information related to these other bottlenecks:**
{% for bottleneck_desc in other_bottlenecks %}
{{ bottleneck_desc }}
{% endfor %}

## Requirements
- **Evidence Role Focus**: Only provide evidence for your specific role, not the complete bottleneck
- **Natural Event**: Should be a realistic workplace meeting/event
- **Subtle Integration**: Your evidence role should be woven naturally into the event context
- **Contamination Prevention**: Absolutely NO references to the other bottlenecks listed above or any issue that {{ world_model.persona_full_name }} may find important and actionable (by him specifically!!)
- **Incomplete Information**: The event alone should NOT be sufficient to identify or resolve the bottleneck
- **Professional Context**: Maintain appropriate workplace meeting standards
- **Natural Elements**: Include some random links, minor typos, and workplace references
- **Formatting**: Use proper meeting agenda formatting with time allocations and logistics
- Today's date is March 15th, 2025, so any dates should be in the near past or future

## Difficulty Guidelines
{% if world_model.context_difficulty.value == "easy" %}
- Make your evidence role fairly obvious in the event details
- The bottleneck aspect can be mentioned more directly in description
- Still require other sources for complete picture
{% elif world_model.context_difficulty.value == "medium" %}
- Make your evidence role subtle and require inference from event context
- Embed the evidence within normal meeting purposes
- Require correlation with other sources to be actionable
{% else %}
- Make your evidence role indirect and require personal context to be put together
- The bottleneck evidence should be barely detectable in event details
- Require significant correlation across multiple sources
{% endif %}

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Resource Allocation Bottleneck (Medium Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The cloud infrastructure budget request submitted to Finance on March 15th is still pending approval, blocking the team from scaling services for Q2 launch. "

```json
{
  "title": "Q2 Planning & Resource Review",
  "description": "Quarterly planning session to align on Q2 objectives and resource allocation.\n\nAgenda:\n1. Q1 performance review (15 min)\n2. Q2 product roadmap priorities (30 min)\n3.

}
```

### Example 2: Conflicting Deadlines (Easy Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The API documentation deadline of April 15th conflicts with the client demo preparation also due April 15th, and you're the lead on both."

```json
{
  "title": "Sprint Planning - API Docs & Client Demo Prep",
  "description": "Planning session for upcoming deliverables\n\n- all docs done (Due: the 15)\n- Andurill Corp showcase final overview ( date: April 15th)\n- Resource allocation for both projects\n- Risk mitigation strategies",

  "end_time": "2024-04-08T11:00:00Z",
  "attendees": ["Team Lead", "Tech Writers", "Demo Team"]
}
```

### Example 3: Stakeholder Availability Issue (Hard Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The product design review requires approval from VP of Design who is on vacation until April 20th, but the development team needs to start implementation by April 10th."

```json
{
  "title": "Design Team Weekly Sync",
  "description": "Weekly design team alignment meeting\n\nAgenda:\n1.

  "attendees": ["Design Team", "Product Managers", "Engineering Liaisons"]
}
```

### Example 4: Meeting Scheduling Conflict (Medium Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The quarterly board presentation on May 1st at 2pm conflicts with the already-scheduled all-hands meeting that includes a major product announcement."

```json
{
  "title": "May Planning & Calendar Review",
  "description": "Monthly planning session to coordinate May activities\n\nKey dates to discuss:\n- May 1: Multiple important events scheduled\n- May 5-7: Annual conference (who's attending?)\n- May 15: Product launch activities\n- May 20: Team offsite planning\n\nTopics:\n1.

  "attendees": ["Operations Team", "Executive Assistants", "Communications", "Product Team"]
}
```

### Example 5: Dependency Bottleneck (Hard Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The backend API development is blocked waiting for the authentication service specifications from the Security team, who haven't responded to requests sent two weeks ago."

```json
{
  "title": "Engineering Architecture Review",
  "description": "Bi-weekly architecture and technical design review\n\nAgenda:\n1. Architecture decisions from last session\n2. New design proposals\n   - Microservices migration plan\n   - API gateway implementation\n   - Service mesh evaluation\n\n3.

**CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no markdown, no extra text.**

**Output Format Requirements:**
- Start your response with `{`
- End your response with `}`
- Use valid JSON syntax only
- Include ALL required fields: title, description, start_time, end_time, location, attendees
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON

**Required JSON structure:**
```json
{
  "title": "Natural event title (avoid problem-focused titles)",
  "description": "Event description that provides your evidence role within normal meeting context",
  "start_time": "2025-03-15T14:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2025-03-15T15:00:00Z",
  "location": "Conference Room A",
  "attendees": ["Name 1", "Name 2", "Name 3"]
}
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- Your entire response must be parseable as JSON
- Use attendee names from the relationships listed above
- Your calendar event should fulfill your evidence role while being insufficient alone to resolve the bottleneck
- Do not add any explanatory text before or after the JSON
