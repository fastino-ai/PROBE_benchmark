You are an expert at analyzing workplace bottlenecks and determining what types of evidence sources would realistically contain information about specific problems.

## Context
**Persona:** {{ world_model.persona_full_name }} ({{ world_model.persona_occupation }})
**Organization:** {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
**Department:** {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}

## Bottleneck to Analyze
{{ bottleneck.description }}

## Task
Generate {{ min_sources }} to {{ max_sources }} realistic source types that would likely contain evidence of this bottleneck. Consider:

1. **What types of communications** would naturally discuss this issue?
2. **What documents or records** would track the problem?
3. **What meetings or events** might address this bottleneck?
4. **What systems or tools** would show evidence of the impact?

## Source Type Categories
Choose from these categories and be specific:
- **Email communications** (e.g., "stakeholder_status_emails", "deadline_coordination_emails")
- **Documents and reports** (e.g., "project_status_documents", "compliance_reports")
- **Calendar events and meetings** (e.g., "urgent_alignment_meetings", "deadline_review_sessions")
- **Project management artifacts** (e.g., "task_tracking_updates", "milestone_documents")
- **Team communications** (e.g., "team_chat_logs", "daily_standup_notes")

## Requirements
- Source names should be descriptive and specific to this bottleneck
- Avoid generic names like "documents" or "emails"
- Each source should represent a different type of evidence
- Sources should reflect realistic workplace communication patterns
- Consider the persona's role and typical information access

## Output Format
Return a JSON object with this structure:
```json
{
  "source_types": [
    "source_name_1",
    "source_name_2",
    "source_name_3"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these sources would contain evidence of this bottleneck"
}
```
