Generate a realistic workplace document that fulfills this specific evidence role while avoiding contamination from other bottlenecks.

## Target Bottleneck
**Description**: {{ bottleneck.description }}
**Type**: {{ bottleneck.type }}

## Your Evidence Role
**Specific Role**: {{ evidence_role }}

This document should provide ONLY the evidence specified in your role. Do NOT include complete information about the bottleneck - other documents will provide the missing pieces.

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team Size**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.team_size }}
- **Reports To**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.reporting_to }}

## Personal Context
- **Work Style**: {{ world_model.personal_context.work_style }}
- **Communication Preferences**: {{ world_model.personal_context.communication_preferences | join(", ") }}
- **Current Priorities**: {{ world_model.personal_context.current_priorities | join(", ") }}
- **Pain Points**: {{ world_model.personal_context.pain_points | join(", ") }}
- **Difficulty**: {{ world_model.context_difficulty.value }}

## Key Relationships
{% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}
- **{{ rel.name }}** ({{ rel.type.value }}): {{ rel.relationship_context }}
{% endfor %}

## CRITICAL: Bottlenecks to AVOID
**You must NOT include any information related to these other bottlenecks:**
{% for bottleneck_desc in other_bottlenecks %}
{{ bottleneck_desc }}
{% endfor %}

## Requirements
- **Evidence Role Focus**: Only provide evidence for your specific role, not the complete bottleneck
- **Document Length**: {{ min_words }}-{{ max_words }} words for the content field
- **Natural Content**: 70-80% of the document should be standard workplace content
- **Subtle Integration**: Your evidence role should be woven naturally into the document
- **Contamination Prevention**: Absolutely NO references to the other bottlenecks listed above or any issue that the user may find important and problematic
- **Incomplete Information**: The document alone should NOT be sufficient to identify or resolve the bottleneck
- **Professional Format**: Maintain appropriate workplace document standards
- **Natural Elements**: Include 1-2 minor typos, realistic internal references/links, and workplace imperfections
- **Formatting**: Use proper business document formatting with headings and structure
- Today's date is March 15th, 2025, so any dates should be in the near past or future

## Anti-Bias Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **BALANCED DETAIL**: Don't make evidence sections significantly more detailed than context
- **TEMPORAL SPREAD**: Use dates from March 10-20, not all March 15th
- **TERM LIMITS**: Use key bottleneck-related names/terms maximum a single time, attempting to always leverage natural alternative phrasing.
- **REALISTIC NOISE**: Include some unrelated sections or tangential content
- **MIXED FORMALITY**: Vary between formal reports and informal notes

## Difficulty Guidelines
{% if world_model.context_difficulty.value == "easy" %}
- Make your evidence role fairly obvious but still incomplete
- The bottleneck aspect can be mentioned more directly
- Still require other sources for complete picture
{% elif world_model.context_difficulty.value == "medium" %}
- Make your evidence role subtle and require inference
- Embed the evidence within other document content
- Require correlation with other sources to be actionable
{% else %}
- Make your evidence role indirect and require personal context to be put together
- The bottleneck evidence should be barely detectable
- Require significant correlation across multiple sources
{% endif %}

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Budget Approval Delay (Medium Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The Q3 marketing budget increase request submitted on June 15th is still pending approval from Finance, preventing the launch of planned campaigns."

### Example 2: Stakeholder Feedback Delay (Hard Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The product roadmap document sent to the executive team on August 1st hasn't received feedback from the CEO, blocking the Q4 planning process."

```json
{

### Example 3: Resource Conflict (Easy Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "Both the mobile app redesign and the API v3 development projects are scheduled to use the same senior developers in October, creating a resource conflict."

```json
{
  "title": "Development Team Resource Planning",
  "content": "Q4 2024 Resource Planning Document\n\nTeam Capacity Overview:\n- Total developers: 12\n- Senior developers: 4\n- Mid-level developers: 5\n- Junior developers: 3\n\nProject Assignments for October:\n\n1. Mobile App Redesign Project\n   - Timeline: October 1-31\n   - Required resources: 2 senior developers, 2 mid-level developers\n   - Key personnel: Sarah Chen (Senior), Michael Park (Senior)\n   - Priority: High\n\n2. API v3 Development\n   - Timeline: October 1-31  \n   - Required resources: 2 senior developers, 3 mid-level developers\n   - Key personnel: Sarah Chen (Senior), Michael Park (Senior)\n   - Priority: High\n\n3. Maintenance and Support\n   - Ongoing\n   - Required resources: 1 mid-level, 2 junior developers\n   - Priority: Medium\n\nResource Utilization Notes:\n- Senior developer capacity appears overcommitted for October\n- Consider staggering project starts or bringing in contractors\n- Skills overlap between projects could enable resource sharing\n\nPrepared by: Development Operations Team\nDate: September 20, 2024",
