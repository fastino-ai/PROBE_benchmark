Generate a routine business email that fulfills this specific evidence role while avoiding contamination from other bottlenecks.

## Target Bottleneck
**Description**: {{ bottleneck.description }}
**Type**: {{ bottleneck.type }}

## Your Evidence Role
**Specific Role**: {{ evidence_role }}

This email should provide ONLY the evidence specified in your role. Do NOT include complete information about the bottleneck - other documents will provide the missing pieces.

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **About**: {{ world_model.persona_about }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Team Size**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.team_size }}
- **Colleagues**: {% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}{{ rel.name }} ({{ rel.type.value }}){% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}
- **Difficulty**: {{ world_model.context_difficulty.value }}

## Available Email Addresses
**IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY these real email addresses from the world model relationships (do NOT invent new ones):
{% for rel in world_model.relationships[:8] %}
- **{{ rel.name }}**: {{ rel.name.lower().replace(' ', '.') }}@{{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name.lower().replace(' ', '').replace('.', '') }}.com
{% endfor %}

## Personal Context
- **Work Style**: {{ world_model.personal_context.work_style }}
- **Communication Preferences**: {{ world_model.personal_context.communication_preferences | join(", ") }}
- **Current Priorities**: {{ world_model.personal_context.current_priorities | join(", ") }}
- **Pain Points**: {{ world_model.personal_context.pain_points | join(", ") }}

## Key Relationships
{% for rel in world_model.relationships[:5] %}
- **{{ rel.name }}** ({{ rel.type.value }}): {{ rel.relationship_context }}
{% endfor %}

## CRITICAL: Bottlenecks to AVOID
**You must NOT include any information related to these other bottlenecks:**
{% for bottleneck_desc in other_bottlenecks %}
{{ bottleneck_desc }}
{% endfor %}

## Requirements
- **Evidence Role Focus**: Only provide evidence for your specific role, not the complete bottleneck
- **Email Length**: {{ min_words }}-{{ max_words }} words for the content field
- **Natural Content**: 70-80% of the email should be unrelated workplace content
- **Subtle Integration**: Your evidence role should be woven naturally into broader communication
- **Contamination Prevention**: Absolutely NO references to the other bottlenecks listed above or any issue that the user may find important and problematic
- **Incomplete Information**: The email alone should NOT be sufficient to identify or resolve the bottleneck
- **Natural Elements**: Include 1-2 minor typos, realistic links/references, and workplace imperfections
- **Formatting**: Use natural workplace email formatting with proper spacing and structure
- Today's date is March 15th, 2025, so any dates should be in the near past or future

## Anti-Bias Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **POPULATED RECIPIENTS**: Always include 1-3 email addresses in to/cc fields from Available Email Addresses
- **BALANCED SPECIFICITY**: Don't make evidence content significantly more specific than context
- **TERM LIMITS**: Try not to use bottleneck key terms, referring to them in natural alternative phrasing.
- **REALISTIC NOISE**: Include some ambiguous or tangentially related content

## Difficulty Guidelines
{% if world_model.context_difficulty.value == "easy" %}
- Make your evidence role fairly obvious but still incomplete
- The bottleneck aspect can be mentioned more directly
- Still require other sources for complete picture
{% elif world_model.context_difficulty.value == "medium" %}
- Make your evidence role subtle and require inference
- Embed the evidence within other workplace topics
- Require correlation with other sources to be actionable
{% else %}
- Make your evidence role indirect and require personal context to be put together
- The bottleneck evidence should be barely detectable
- Require significant correlation across multiple sources
- Undiscoverable by keyword matching
{% endif %}

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 2: Budget Approval Bottleneck (Hard Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "The cloud infrastructure expansion budget request submitted to Finance on August 30th hasn't been approved, preventing the team from scaling services for the upcoming product launch."

```json

### Example 3: Meeting Conflict Bottleneck (Easy Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "You have two important meetings scheduled at the same time on Tuesday at 2pm: the product roadmap review with the CEO and the client presentation with ABC Corp."

```json
{
  "subject": "Quick scheduling changes",
  "sender": "[use actual colleague email from Available Email Addresses section]",

  "timestamp": "2024-09-27T17:20:00Z"

```

### Example 5: Engineering Team requires more resources (Hard Difficulty)
**Bottleneck**: "Persona (Joe) is a staffing manager for a project. The new hire requisition for a senior engineer submitted for the project to HR three weeks ago hasn't been approved, delaying critical project staffing."

```json
{
  "subject": "Engineering Team Updates",
  "sender": "[use actual colleague email from Available Email Addresses section]",
  "content": "Hey Engineering Team!\n\n Hope that all is going well and that you are preparing for a very pleasant holiday season ahead. On my part, I am particularly excited for the office holiday party, which will be takin place next week in Conference Hall 277. Partners are welcome! Please show up \nWhat a week, wanted to go over notable accomplishments for the week: we, with the help of a strong effort from Alex Armstrong, got 75% of the way through the present sample analysis PR and it will soon be ready to review. The sample analysis PR is a PR that we've been working through for some time, and will introduce the following features. *Sample Efficient semi-supervised online learning* - we're able to greatly speed up the learning rate of our product recommender by interacting with the wants and needs of users in real time. *Multi-modal recommendation systems* - we're now able to effectively use screenshots of the users screen and audio recordings of their previous interactions to classify desired clothing items in real time. This has led to a 20-30% relative performance gain in our classifiers, which is a big boost in a competitive field like ours where performance margins are quite small. *Parallelizability* - our training is both model parallel and data parallel now, leading to 7X efficiency gains relative to V1.0. Not bad for a spring of a single week! we've also made good progress on the new data cleaning pipeline, and the team is making great strides in getting the new system ready to go live. We'll soon need to review the top prioritized bugs and features for the quarter ahead, which is a project I'm quite excited about. Remembeer that Finn will be OOO the next few weeks on paternity leave, so there is a chance we're going to need some of you to step up on the engineering load at this point. Tried to get new guy for the team to work on our RAG pipeline, having some difficulty with approval. Engineers- would really appreciate some extra work this weekend if at all possible to make out for lost capacity, I'd really like to get this system humming in production. I think every day when this system is not in our product is a day where salespeople in our company continue to make uninformed follow-up decisions, and we're losing monitary value in real time. May as well shift as fast as we possible can and do mass debugging and QA a week from now as the model is going through the company's approval process.  Might need one of the two staffing people on the team to help out with that. Beyond this, we're getting really good results from the new system and I'm very happy about the way we've gotten up and running. Thank you to everyone for your contributions, and have a wonderful week ahead! Best, Jonathan Jones. ",

Instructions:
1. Write a NATURAL email that would realistically occur in this workplace
2. Embed the bottleneck evidence subtly within broader workplace communication
3. The evidence should be just one small part of a larger email
4. For higher difficulties, make the evidence more implicit, more subtle (issue not found in the title/beginning of the email), and more reliant on the context provided to you
5. Include plenty of unrelated but realistic workplace content
6. Avoid using words like "bottleneck", "problem", "issue", "conflict" in obvious ways

**CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no markdown, no extra text.**

**Output Format Requirements:**
- Start your response with `{`
- End your response with `}`
- Use valid JSON syntax only
- Include ALL required fields: subject, sender, to, cc, content, timestamp
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON

**Required JSON structure:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Natural email subject (avoid problem-focused subjects)",
  "sender": "email_address_from_available_list_above",
  "to": ["recipient1@company.com", "recipient2@company.com"],
  "cc": ["cc_recipient@company.com"],
  "content": "Natural email body that provides your evidence role within broader workplace content ({{ min_words }}-{{ max_words }} words)",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Remember**: Your email should fulfill your evidence role while being insufficient alone to resolve the bottleneck. Other sources will provide the missing information needed for a complete picture.
**IMPORTANT**:
- Your entire response must be parseable as JSON
- The sender MUST be one of the actual email addresses from the "Available Email Addresses" section above
- Your email should fulfill your evidence role while being insufficient alone to resolve the bottleneck
- Do not add any explanatory text before or after the JSON
