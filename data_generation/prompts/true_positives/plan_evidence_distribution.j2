You are tasked with creating a coordinated plan for distributing bottleneck evidence across multiple workplace documents. This plan ensures that no single document contains complete information and that evidence must be correlated across sources.

## Target Bottleneck
**Description**: {{ bottleneck.description }}
**Type**: {{ bottleneck.type }}

## Context
- **Persona**: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
- **Occupation**: {{ world_model.persona_occupation }}
- **Company**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
- **Department**: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
- **Difficulty**: {{ difficulty }}

## Sources to Generate Evidence For
{% for source in expected_sources %}
- {{ source }}
{% endfor %}

## Other Bottlenecks to AVOID
**CRITICAL**: The evidence must NOT contain any information related to these other bottlenecks:
{% for bottleneck_desc in other_bottlenecks %}
{{ bottleneck_desc }}
{% endfor %}

## Planning Requirements

1. **Evidence Distribution**: Each source should provide only PARTIAL and very subtle/incomplete evidence for the target bottleneck
2. **Coordination**: Evidence should require correlation across multiple sources to be actionable
3. **Contamination Prevention**: Ensure NO evidence relates to the other bottlenecks listed above or any issue that the user may find important and problematic.
4. **Quantitative Difficulty Requirements**:
   - Easy: Direct keyword overlap (30-50%), evidence obvious when combined, minimal inference needed
   - Medium: Moderate keyword overlap (10-20%), requires connecting 2-3 concepts, some domain knowledge needed
   - Hard: No keyword overlap with bottleneck, requires 4+ conceptual connections, thorough personal context, indirect references only

## Planning Instructions

Create a plan that assigns each source both a document type and a specific role in revealing the bottleneck. For each source:
- Assign a document type: "email", "calendar", or "document"
- Define an evidence role (what aspect of the bottleneck it reveals)
- Ensure variety across document types (don't make everything the same type)
- Make each source completely insufficient on its own to identify or resolve the bottleneck. The bottleneck should require all sources to be put together.
- Avoid any contamination from other bottlenecks

## Anti-Bias Planning Requirements
- **Distribute key terms**: Don't concentrate all important names/terms in one source
- **Vary evidence clarity**: Use subtle evidence across sources
- **Include noise**: Plan for each source to include some unrelated content
- **Temporal distribution**: Plan sources to have different dates (March 10-20)
- **Balance specificity**: Don't make all evidence highly specific

**CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no markdown, no extra text.**

**Output Format Requirements:**
- Start your response with `{`
- End your response with `}`
- Use valid JSON syntax only
- Include ALL required fields
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON

**Required JSON structure:**

```json
{
  "coordination_strategy": "Brief description of how the sources work together across document types",
  "source_plans": [
    {
      "source": "source_name_from_list_above",
      "document_type": "email|calendar|document",
      "evidence_role": "Specific role this source plays in revealing the bottleneck",
      "key_elements": ["Element 1", "Element 2", "Element 3"],
      "why_insufficient_alone": "Explanation of why this source alone cannot resolve the bottleneck"
    }
  ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: Your entire response must be parseable as JSON. Do not add any explanatory text.

## Example Planning

**Target Bottleneck**: "The Q3 marketing strategy document sent to Sarah Chen on September 15th is still awaiting her feedback, which is blocking the campaign launch scheduled for October 1st."

**Sources**: ["email_threads", "project_documents", "calendar_events"]

```json
{
  "coordination_strategy": "Evidence is distributed across communication channels - emails show follow-up attempts, documents show incomplete status, calendar shows approaching deadlines",
  "source_plans": [
    {
      "source": "email_threads",
      "document_type": "email",
      "evidence_role": "Show that there is a huge  campaign launch upcoming, and it is an important one to the persona",
      "key_elements": ["Casual mention of pending feedback", "Indirect timeline references", "General project status"],
      "why_insufficient_alone": "Doesn't specify what document or who is causing the delay"
    },
    {
      "source": "document",
      "document_type": "document",
      "evidence_role": "Show that the campaign is - in part - dependent on the Q3 marketing strategy document",
      "key_elements": ["Draft status indicators", "Approval workflow references", "Incomplete sections"],
      "why_insufficient_alone": "Doesn't show the communication attempts or timeline pressure"
    },
    {
      "source": "calendar_event",
      "document_type": "calendar",
      "evidence_role": "Show that, along  withothers, Sarah Chen was invited to discuss contributing to the marketing strategy doc a week before and named one of the primary contributors.",
      "key_elements": ["Campaign launch date", "Review meeting scheduling", "Timeline constraints"],
      "why_insufficient_alone": "Doesn't identify what specifically is delayed or who is responsible"
    },
    {
      "source": "personal_emails",
      "document_type": "email",
      "evidence_role": "Show that Sarah Chen promised last week to have the marketing strategy document ready before the calendar event she was invited to",
      "key_elements": ["Casual mention of pending feedback", "Indirect timeline references", "General project status"],
      "why_insufficient_alone": "Doesn't specify what document or who is causing the delay"
    },
  ]
}
```

Now create the coordinated evidence plan for the target bottleneck and sources listed above.
