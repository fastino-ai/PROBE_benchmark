You are evaluating whether an AI agent correctly identified a bottleneck using precision-based scoring.

## Context
The agent was given various documents and data sources to analyze, and needed to identify the bottleneck affecting productivity.

## Workplace Context
Persona: {{ world_model.persona_full_name }}
Company: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.company_name }}
Department: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.department }}
Team Size: {{ world_model.organizational_structure.team_size }}

## What the Agent Identified
"{{ identified_bottleneck }}"

## The Actual Bottleneck
"{{ actual_bottleneck }}"

## Two-Tier Precision Scoring System

### ESSENTIAL DETAILS (Must be 100% correct for any points)
These are execution-critical details required for immediate action:

1. **WHO_BLOCKED**: The exact person/entity being blocked (specific names, not roles)
2. **WHO_BLOCKER**: The exact person/entity causing the blockage (specific names, not roles)
3. **WHAT_TASK**: The specific deliverable/work item that's blocked (exact names, not generic descriptions)
4. **WHY_ROOT_CAUSE**: The true underlying reason for the blockage (not symptoms)

### NON-ESSENTIAL DETAILS (Can have minor errors/omissions)
These provide context but aren't critical for immediate resolution:

5. **WHEN_DEADLINE**: Specific dates and timelines
6. **WHERE_SYSTEM**: Exact system/tool names and locations
7. **HOW_MECHANISM**: Detailed process or workflow information
8. **IMPACT_SCOPE**: Downstream effects and dependencies

## Scoring Rules

**CORRECT (1.0)**: All essential details are accurate AND all non-essential details are accurate
**PARTIALLY_CORRECT (0.5)**: All essential details are accurate BUT has errors/omissions in non-essential details
**INCORRECT (0.0)**: Any essential detail is wrong, missing, or too vague

## Essential Detail Requirements
- **Names must be specific**: "Timothy" not "someone from finance"
- **Systems must be exact**: "econo.com" not "financial system"
- **Tasks must be precise**: "Q3 financials initiative" not "quarterly report"
- **Root causes must be accurate**: "Martha stripped access" not "system issues"

## Examples

### Example 1: CORRECT (1.0)
**Actual**: Timothy isn't meeting the March 23rd deadline for his Q3 financials initiative because Martha revoked his econo.com access to company financials.

**Agent**: Timothy cannot complete his Q3 financials initiative by the March 23rd deadline because Martha removed his access to company financials through econo.com.

**Analysis**:
- ✅ WHO_BLOCKED: Timothy (correct)
- ✅ WHO_BLOCKER: Martha (correct)
- ✅ WHAT_TASK: Q3 financials initiative (correct)
- ✅ WHY_ROOT_CAUSE: Martha revoked access (correct)
- ✅ All non-essential details accurate

### Example 2: PARTIALLY_CORRECT (0.5)
**Actual**: Timothy isn't meeting the March 23rd deadline for his Q3 financials initiative because Martha revoked his econo.com access to company financials.

**Agent**: Timothy cannot complete his Q3 financials initiative because Martha removed his access to company financial systems.

**Analysis**:
- ✅ WHO_BLOCKED: Timothy (correct)
- ✅ WHO_BLOCKER: Martha (correct)
- ✅ WHAT_TASK: Q3 financials initiative (correct)
- ✅ WHY_ROOT_CAUSE: Martha revoked access (correct)
- ❌ WHEN_DEADLINE: Missing March 23rd
- ❌ WHERE_SYSTEM: "financial systems" instead of "econo.com"

### Example 3: INCORRECT (0.0)
**Actual**: Timothy isn't meeting the March 23rd deadline for his Q3 financials initiative because Martha revoked his econo.com access to company financials.

**Agent**: Someone from finance is having trouble with their quarterly report due to system access issues.

**Analysis**:
- ❌ WHO_BLOCKED: "someone from finance" instead of Timothy
- ❌ WHO_BLOCKER: Missing Martha entirely
- ❌ WHAT_TASK: "quarterly report" instead of Q3 financials initiative
- ❌ WHY_ROOT_CAUSE: "system issues" instead of Martha's action
